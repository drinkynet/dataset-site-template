# dataset-site-template

## About
This repository contains a [mustache template](https://openactive.io/dataset-site-template/datasetsite.mustache) for creating an OpenActive dataset site, similar to those that can be found at https://status.openactive.io.

It is designed to be embedded in a booking system, and easily customised.

## Getting started

Please see here for full documentation: https://developer.openactive.io/publishing-data/dataset-sites

## Important notes for production use

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MUSTACHE FILE LIVE, IT MUST BE SAVED LOCALLY TO PREVENT XSS ATTACKS
- DO NOT RENDER THIS FILE CLIENT-SIDE, IT MUST BE RENDERED SERVER-SIDE FOR SEO

## Usage

Simply construct the JSON-LD found in [example.json](https://openactive.io/dataset-site-template/example.json) based on your organisation (for single database systems) or your customers' own properties (for multiple database systems), then process it with the following steps.

Steps to render the template:

1. Stringify the input JSON, and place the contents of the string within the `"json"` property at the root of the JSON itself. **This is important as it is used to populate the machine-readable `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag within the generated HTML - view the source of [this page](https://reference-implementation.openactive.io/OpenActive) to see an example.**
2. Use the resulting JSON with the mustache template to render the dataset site.
